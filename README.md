Here is a summary of the contents of each file:

server.js: This file contains the code for the backend of the web app, using the express library to set up a server and the openai library to send API requests to OpenAI's API.
index.html: This file contains the HTML code for the frontend of the web app, including the form for the script and famous co-author, and the element to display the rewritten script.
script.js: This file contains the JavaScript code that handles the form submission and communicates with the backend, using jQuery to send a POST request to the server and update the page with the rewritten script.
You will need to save these three files in the same directory, and then you can run the server.js file to start the web app.
